<summary>Introduction</summary>

<ol>
   <li>
      Notwithstanding the heading below referring to "The Game",
      this list has a serious purpose, namely to suggest that
      conventional Western music notation is far more complex and
      subtle than most people think. In particular, it does not
      have well-defined borders; it just fades away indefinitely
      in all directions. It's widely understood that what music
      notation means &mdash; its semantics &mdash; is ill-defined.
      But even  what constitutes valid notation &mdash; its syntax
      &mdash; is ill-defined, and even for individual symbols
      regardless of context. For example, there's no limit on the
      shortest note duration, on the number of <i>p</i>'s or
      <i>f</i>'s in a dynamic mark, or even on the number of
      accidentals on a note.  This list includes published music
      with 2048th notes, with markings of <i>pppppppp</i> (eight
      <i>p</i>'s) and <i>ffffffff</i> (eight <i>f</i>'s), and with
      triple sharps and triple flats. I'm confident that the existence
      of every one of these would surprise most musicians, including
      music theorists and musicologists; but no one can say that
      even shorter notes, larger numbers of <i>p</i>'s or <i>f</i>'s,
      or quadruple sharps or flats aren't possible or valid.
   </li>

   <li> Rules of The Game
      <ol type="a">
    <li>
       Only published works are considered, except for music old
       enough that publication may not be a meaningful concept.
       Also, in general, implicit notation is excluded, e.g.,
       Renaissance notation that is equivalent to complex tuplets.
       Where there's a tie among several works, I've tried to
       emphasize those that are the most "mainstream", especially
       in terms of composer and publisher.  But works listed are
       automatically biased heavily towards mainstream works, and
       especially those by very well-known composers, since I'm
       less likely to even know about details in other works. (I
       doubt if Bach, Beethoven, etc., were really such great
       pioneers of notation as this document seems to indicate!)
       Runners-up are often listed: this is useful to give an idea
       of how unusual, and therefore how significant, the extreme
       is &mdash; both in practical terms and as a feature of what
       computer scientists would call <i>music representation</i>).
    </li>

    <li>
       Another question is what to do about what is sometimes called
       &#147;antimusic&#148;, &#147;conceptual music&#148;, and so
       on. This includes pieces that are obviously unplayable or
       inaudible, e.g., with notes on so many ledger lines they're
       above the hearing range even of dogs, and pieces containing
       zero notes or to be repeated forever. I generally show such
       items in square brackets "[ ]", but don't take them seriously
       as extremes.  Naturally, the borderlines are not well-defined.
       There are also pieces that are perfectly playable and audible
       but whose interest is primarily conceptual, e.g., works that
       consist of a single note, and works of significant musical
       interest but in which the extreme feature is conceptual,
       e.g., where the piece is to be repeated in its entirety
       hundreds of times or forever. These are handled on a
       case-by-case basis. (Examples of each of the features mentioned
       in this paragraph appear herein.)
    </li>

    <li>
       Jokes and parodies of music notation like the well-known
       "Fairies Aire and Death Waltz", with its 32,768th note (or
       is it a 65,536th?) and so on, form a related category.  These
       may be interesting, but not for my purposes.
    </li>

    <li>
       An important borderline case of music whose interest might
       be primarily conceptual is the "new complexity" music. To
       cite just one example, Brian Ferneyhough: String Quartet no.
       3 (1987; Peters ed.), II, includes a number of tuplets nested
       4 levels deep, and several meters with non-power-of-2
       denominators, e.g., 2/10 and 1/12. My personal inclination
       is strongly towards considering such work as of more conceptual
       than musical interest, but this is probably unfair: even if
       I'm right, it might still have substantial musical interest!
       And I've rarely (if ever) listened to this music, so I really
       can't say. But see below for more on Ferneyhough's use of
       nested tuplets. </li> <li> Though this list concentrates on
       notation, some "sound" aspects are included, e.g., extreme
       sounding as well as written pitches.
    </li>
      </ol>
   </li>

   <li>
      A related collection of examples of unusual music notation
      appears in Byrd (1984) and a supplement, <a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/MoreCMNCounterexamples.htm">More
      Counterexamples in Conventional Music Notation</a> (Byrd,
      2017b).  That collection concentrates not on extremes but on
      notation that breaks the supposed rules, e.g., two clefs
      simultaneously active on the same staff, time-signature changes
      in the middle of a measure.  Byrd (1994) discusses at some
      length a few items from the original collection. However, the
      dividing line between extremes and rule-breaking is often
      unclear. In any case, the <a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/InterestingMusicNotation.html">Gallery
      of Interesting Music Notation</a> webpage (Byrd, 2017a) shows
      and comments on particularly interesting examples of both.

      kinds, Noam Elkies and Gavin Jared Bala are in a class by

<summary>Pitch</summary>

<p>
   Octave notation here is in the international standard ISO system,
   formerly known as the ASA (Acoustical Society of America) or
   ANSI system. In this system, middle C (MIDI note number 60) is
   C4; octaves start with C, so the B just below (MIDI number 59)
   is B3. The lowest note of the normal 88-key modern piano is A0
   (MIDI 21); the highest note is C8 (MIDI 108). (Boesendorfer
   Imperials, which have existed since ca. 1900, go down to F0 or
   even C0. And Stuart &amp; Sons of New South Wales, Australia now
   make a 102-key piano with a range of C0 to F8 (contributed by
   Baltuch); I believe they introduced it just a few years ago.)
</p>



<h3>1. Most ledger lines {B&amp;I 4.7}</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
      Above staff: 9 in Martino: Pianississimo (1970), for C8.
      <br />Runners-up: 8 in Pianississimo for several A7's and B7's;
      8 in Shostakovich: Piano Trio no. 2 in E minor, Op. 67, end
      of first movement, violin part (International ed.; contributed
      by Elkies); 7 in Sibelius: Violin Concerto (1905; Kalmus ed.),
      III, for F#7 in solo part (occurs many times); Schoenberg:
      Violin Concerto (1936); Davidovsky: Synchronism no. 1; etc.
      [Tom Johnson: Celestial Music for Imaginary Trumpets (1974)
      contains a chord whose top note is about 100(!) ledger lines
      above the staff, in treble clef.]
   </li>

   <li>
      Below staff: 6 is fairly common in piano music for B0 or A0,
      e.g., Brahms: Rhapsodies, Op. 79, both nos. 1 and 2 (Peters/Sauer
      ed.); Debussy: Pour le Piano (1901; Schirmer ed.), I.
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>2. Extreme pitches {B&amp;I 4.7}</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
      Highest written and sounding: G#8 (MIDI note number 116) in
      Salvatore Sciarrino: Six Caprices for Violin, no. 1 (1976)
      (in harmonics).  Runners-up: D8 in Scriabin: Piano Sonata no.
      6, Op. 62 (1911, Dover &amp; Schirmer eds.), last page
      (contributed by Dovey) (an editorial footnote in the Schirmer
      edition comments that this note "did not yet exist" on pianos;
      in fact, as far as I know, it didn't exist until the creation
      of the Stuart &amp; Sons 102-key piano of the 21st century);
      also in Percy Grainger: *Let's Dance Gay in Green Meadow
      (Faber ed.) (contributed by Andrew Plant via Alistair Craft).
      Lesser runners-up include C#8 in Paganini: Violin Concerto
      no. 1, Op. 6 (1817), III, solo part, and Schoenberg: Violin
      Concerto, Op. 36 (1936), solo part (in harmonics in both
      pieces). [The note in Tom Johnson: Celestial Music for Imaginary
      Trumpets mentioned above, about 100 ledger lines above a staff
      in treble clef, would have a frequency of many gigahertz
      &mdash; way, way above the audible range; even dogs can hear
      only up to about 60 kilohertz!]
   </li>

   <li>
      Lowest written and sounding: C0 (MIDI note 12) in Alexandre
      Guilmant: Organ Sonata no. 5 in c, Op. 80 (before 1909; Dover
      ed.), V, end (written C2 with a 32-ft. stop); in William
      Kraft: Encounters II for solo tuba (MCA Music, 1970) (contributed
      by Tinkham); and in William Bolcom: *Piano Concerto (1976)
      (contributed by White). This note has a frequency of 16.4 Hz,
      while it's generally considered that the lowest frequency
      that's heard as a pitch is about 20 Hz. Runners-up: E-flat-0
      (MIDI 15) in La Monte Young: *Well-Tuned Piano (written for
      a specially-tuned Boesendorfer Imperial; apparently unpublished,
      like all his works, so not really in the scope of this list),
      frequency 18.6 Hz in Young's tuning system (contributed by
      Grimshaw); F0 (MIDI 17) in Bartok: Piano Sonata (1926; Boosey
      &amp; Hawkes ed.), II, frequency 21.8 Hz &mdash; this is also
      outside the range of all but a few pianos.
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>
   3. Extreme accidentals {B&amp;I 4.8} and key signature {B&amp;I
   9.1}
</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
      <p>Regarding accidentals, triple sharps appear in *Fugue no.
      34 of Anton Reicha: 36 Fugues for Piano (ca. 1805) (Magasin
      de l'imprimerie chymique ed.), m. 56, left hand (a C#x lower
      neighbor between two Dx's) (contributed by Nicholas); in
      Alkan: Etude no. 10 from Douze etudes dans tous les tons
      mineur, Op. 39 (1857) (contributed by Starr); and near the
      end of the last movement of Reger: Clarinet Sonata, Op. 49
      no. 2, piano part (1904; Universal ed.) (F#x, used as a lower
      neighbor between two Gx's) (contributed by McCanna).</p>

      <p>The Alkan and Reger instances are each in a passage in 6
      sharps; the Reicha has no key signature, making multiple
      sharps that much more remote in terms of tonality.</p>

      <p>Triple flats (for Bbbb) occur in Nikolai Roslavets (or
      Roslawez): Piano Sonata No. 1 (1914; Schott ed.), mm. 152 and
      153 &mdash; along with double flats in the same passage, their
      individual flats have their "stems" linked with "beams"!
      (contributed by Hook); they also occur in Galina Ustvolskaya:
      Piano Sonata No. 3, p. 30 (contributed by Cordiero).</p>
   </li>

   <li>
      <p>A key signature of 6 sharps and a double-sharp &mdash; the
      equivalent of 8 sharps &mdash; appears in the final pages the
      vocal score of John Foulds: *A World Requiem; the passage is
      in G-sharp major (contributed by Bala).</p>

      <p>A key signature of 8 flats appears in Victor Ewald's
      (brass) Quintet No. 4, III: the movement is in F-flat major.
      (contributed by Miller)</p>

      <p>Runners-up: Key signatures of 7 sharps and of 7 flats are
      not too unusual. 7 sharps is used in J.S. Bach: The Well-Tempered
      Clavier, Books I and II, for a prelude and fugue in C-sharp
      major in each (in B &amp; M, 1948). 7 sharps is also used for
      C-sharp major at the end of the second movement of Schubert's
      last piano sonata (D.960, in B-flat) (contributed by Elkies).
      7 flats is used for A-flat minor in Beethoven: Piano Sonata
      no. 12, Op. 26, I and III (contributed by Tinkham); also in
      Brahms: Horn Trio, Op.40, II (in B &amp; M, 1948; contributed
      by Elkies).</p>

      <p>Note: Key signatures of up to one triple-flat + six
      double-flats = 15 normal flats (!) appear in Dumitrescu (2007),
      pp. 141-170.  However, it's not clear that this qualifies as
      CMN. (contributed by Hook, who comments: "This is a modern
      realization of a 16th-century motet. The original manuscript
      was written in a circle. The author doing the reconstruction
      argues that the proper way to perform it requires adding flats
      at each repetition, and this is where that brings us by the
      third page.")</p>
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>4. Extreme ottava {B&amp;I 13.1}</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
      15ma: Contrary to popular belief, 15ma (2 octaves transposition)
      is quite rare, though probably less so in the last 50 years
      or so than before. Still, the only instances I know of of
      15ma alta in a well-known work are in the solo part of Ravel:
      Piano Concerto (Durand ed., 1932(), III (NB that this is
      incorrectly printed as "16a"). It's also used repeatedly in
      Messiaen's Oiseaux Exotiques (1956; Universal ed., 1959; again
      shown as "16"), plus piano music by Cowell (Advertisement,
      1914; Associated ed.), Feldman (Durations III, no. 3, 1962),
      etc.
   </li>

   <li>
      15ma bassa: The only instances I know of are for tone clusters
      in Cowell: The Tides of Manaunaun (probably written in 1917,
      though Cowell claimed 1912; Associated ed.) for piano; for
      the C0 in William Kraft: Encounters II for solo tuba (contributed
      by Tinkham); and for C0 for tuba in William Bolcom: *Piano
      Concerto (1976) (contributed by White).
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>
   5. Widest skip and range in a melody.
	<h4>
		(NB: of course the term
   	"melody" isn't at all well-defined; as a result, many of these
   	extremes are open to question.)
	</h4>
</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
      Widest skip: 5 octaves + perfect 5th (67 semitones) in
      Beethoven: Piano Sonata no. 32, Op. 111 (1822), I, m. 116.
      (It's 5 octaves + minor 7th (70 semitones) in some editions;
      the old Bulow/Lebert ed. acknowledges the editors changed the
      higher note, justified by inference from the range of the
      Broadwood piano Beethoven had when he wrote the piece and by
      analogy with the passage with the runner-up wide skip in the
      same piece!)
   </li>

   <li>
      Runners-up for widest skip: 4 octaves + dim. 7th (57 semitones)
      in Beethoven: Piano Sonata no. 32, Op. 111, I, m. 49; 4 octaves
      (48 semitones) in D. Scarlatti: Sonata in c, L. 360, K. 22;
      3 octaves + P 4th (41 st) in violin 1 of Beethoven: Quartet
      Op. 59 #3, I, ca. mm. 57-58, and in the solo part of Mozart:
      Piano Concerto no. 21, II (both contributed by Elkies).
   </li>

   <li>
      Widest overall range: 5 octaves + perfect 4th (65 st) in
      Saint-Saens: Cello Concerto no. 1, Op. 33, in a long, slow
      scale (pp. 53-54, Durand/Dover ed.). (This is arguably not
      part of a melody, but it's by far the most salient part of
      the texture for eight measures.) Runners-up: 4 octaves + maj
      6th (57 st) in Beethoven: "Hammerklavier" Sonata, Op. 106, I
      &mdash; except that 2 octaves of this is really a change of
      texture (via doubling). A better choice might be 4 octaves
      and at least a maj 3rd (52 st), perhaps a maj 6th (57 st),
      in Chopin: Etude in C major, Op. 10 no. 1: here the uncertainty
      is because it's not at all clear where the melody ends;
      however, none of it has a very melodic character in the normal
      sense.
   </li>

   <li>
      Runner-up for widest range: 3 octaves + min 2nd (37 st) in
      Mozart: Violin Concerto no. 5 ("Turkish"), I.
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>
   6. Most repeated notes in a melody.

   <h4>
      See above comments about the term "melody".  Counts are of
      sounding notes, i.e., only notes with attacks, not tied notes.
      Only written out notes qualify, not tremolo.

      Without rhythmic variety (all notes the same sounding duration).
      32 in Prokofieff: Toccata, Op. 11 (1912), m. 1 (first different
      pitch = maj 2nd up). It might be argued that this isn't a
      melody, but it's the beginning of the piece, unaccompanied,
      recurs in important places, etc. Runners-up: 15 in Khachaturian:
      Sabre Dance from "Gayane" (first different pitch = maj 2nd
      down); 14 in Beethoven: "Waldstein" Sonata, Op. 53, I, m.5
      (first different pitch = maj 2nd up).
   </li>

   <li>
      With at least some rhythmic variety (one or more notes with
      different sounding duration). The 80 notes that comprise the
      entire voice part of Peter Cornelius's song "Ein Ton", Op. 3
      #3 (contributed by Elkies). Runners-up: 50 in Chopin's song
      "Leci liscie z drzewa" ("Leaves are falling"), Op. 74 no. 17,
      mm. 50-67. 48 of the 50 are in one phrase (first different

      Porter's "Night and Day" (contributed by Elkies). 30 in Jobim:
      One Note Samba (first different pitch = 4th up); here the
      number of repeated written notes is much larger, since many
      of the notes are tied. 20 in Bartok: Piano Sonata (1926), II,

<summary>Rhythm and Duration</summary>


<h3>1. Shortest notated duration</h3>

<ol type="a">
   <li>For normal notes {B&amp;I 4.5}
   	<ol type="i">
      	<li>
    			m. 16 of Anthony Phillip Heinrich: Toccata Grande Cromatica
    			from The Sylviad, Set 2 (ca. 1825), uses 1024th and even two
    			2048th(!) notes (in <a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/InterestingMusicNotation.html">Byrd,
    			2017a)</a>. However, the context shows clearly that these notes
    			have one beam more than they should, so they should really be
    			512th and 1024th notes, respectively. The passage -- in 2/4,
    			marked "Grave" -- also contains many 256th notes.  It's easy
    			to argue that these durations are ridiculous: even at a tempo
    			as slow as M.M. eighth = 40 (quarter = 20), a 1024th note would
    			last only about 12 millisec.; cf. "Shortest performed duration"
    			below. However, Heinrich obviously wanted a huge ritardando
    			here, so they may not be so unreasonable after all. See J.B.
    			Clark, The Dawning of American Keyboard Music (Greenwood Press,
    			1988), p. 365. (contributed by Shumway) (The first page of Ives:
    			"Concord" Piano Sonata no. 2 (completed 1915) (Kalmus ed.), IV
    			("Thoreau") contains a beamed group of 64th notes ending with
    			two 1024th notes, but it's pretty clear that the additional
    			beams on the "1024ths" are a mistake; they should just be 64ths.)
			</li>

			<li>
	    		Runners-up: 256th notes appear in Vivaldi: Concerto in
	    		C for ottavino, archi e cembalo, F. IV n. 5; Boguslav
	    		Schaeffer: *4 Movements for Piano and Orch. (mentioned
	    		in Read (1969), p. 117); the last variation in some
	    		editions (e.g. the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe) of Mozart's 12
	    		Variations on "Je suis Lindor", K. 354 (contributed by
	    		Bala); and some editions (e.g., Barenreiter) of Beethoven:
	    		Piano Concerto no. 3, II. (In the CCARH 1987 Directory,
	    		Dydo says 256th notes occur in Telemann but gives no
	    		details. Perhaps he was thinking of the Vivaldi piece,
	    		though it's been suggested there are 256ths in the
	    		Gulliver Suite, but I haven't checked.)
	 		</li>

	 		<li>
	    		Interesting runners-up are 15:8 128ths in Beethoven:
	    		Piano Concerto no. 3, II, and Bartok:  Rhapsody, Op. 1
	    		(1904; Boosey &amp; Hawkes ed.). These are very nearly as
	    		short as 256th notes.

	<li>For grace notes (including appoggiaturas) {B&amp;I 5.5}
		<ol type="i">

	    		128th grace notes in Alkan: Trois Grandes Etudes, Op.
	    		76 (Billaudot ed.), no. 2, 3 mm. before the end
	    		(contributed by Dickenson).

<br /><h3>2. Longest notated duration, including ties</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      In both measures and durational units (i.e., fixed units like
      quarters or wholes): Verdi: Otello (1887), Act I, opens with
      a pedal point in the organ of the tone cluster(!) C2,C#2,D2,
      lasting 244 measures of 4/4 (= 976 quarters). (contributed
      by Starr)
   </li>

	<li>
      Runners-up (all distant) in durational units: Bartok: The
      Wooden Prince (1914-17) opens with 120 measures of tied dotted
      halfs (= 360 quarters) of timpani roll on one pitch, but it's
      not clear this counts, since (despite the tie) ia timpani
      roll really reiterates the note many times. There are tied
      notes equivalent to 140 quarters in Beethoven: Symphony No.
      9, II, basses, though peculiarities of the notation vaguely
      suggest subdivisions into sections the longest of which is
      88 quarters.

		Unimpeachable runners-up are

      Brahms: A German Requiem, end of the 3rd movement (30 bars
      of 4/2 = 240 quarters);

      Ravel: *L'Enfant et les Sortileges, "pastorelles" section of
      Act I, bottom half of the alto section (84+ bars of 2/4 =
      168.5 quarters) (contributed by Elkies); and Beethoven:
      Symphony no. 5, III, violas (43 measures of tied dotted halfs
      = 129 quarters).
	</li>

	<li>
       Runner-up  (distant) in measures: Bach: Organ Toccata in F
       major begins with a pedal point of 54(?) measures (of 3/8;
       = 81 quarters).
   </li>

	<li>
      Notre Dame organum in CMN transcriptions has some fairly
      strong contenders, though nothing comparable to Otello. Cf.
      especially Perotin: Viderunt Omnes, "the F-major toccata of
      the 13th century", and Sederunt; each begins with what looks
      in a modern edition like 50 or 60 measures (= 150 or 180
      quarters) of 6/8 of one tenor note.
   </li>

	<li>
      Longest continuous trill (considering only "real" trills in
      terms of both notation and sound; not timpani rolls, written-out
      fingered tremolos, etc.) on a single pitch:

      in measures and durational units, 15 measures of 3/4 in
      Beethoven: Diabelli Variations, Op. 120 (Breitkopf &amp; Hartel
      ed.), Variation XX, mm. 17-31; in measures (and runner-up in
      durational units), 10 measures of 3/4 in Chopin: Mazurka no.
      53; in durational units (and runner-up in measures), 9 bars
      of 2/2 in Mozart: *Piano Quartet in G minor, K 478, third
      movement, piano part, bars 311 to 319 (contributed by Bala).
      Runner-up in durational units and measures: 8 bars of 2/2 in
      Beethoven's cadenza to the Rondo of Mozart's D-minor piano
      concerto, K. 466 (contributed by Elkies).
   </li>

	<li>
      Longest multi-measure rest, in measures {B&amp;I 6.5}: the organ
      part of Strauss: An Alpine Symphony (1915) opens with a
      multibar rest labelled "tacet bis:", followed by rehearsal
      mark 94, then seven measures of rests with cues. The initial
      rest fills 695 measures. However, for a number that actually
      appears in the music, the largest I know of is 463 in a
      transcription of John Coltrane's version of the Rodgers &amp;
      Hammerstein song My Favorite Things, in Coltrane Plays
      Standards, p. 35 (Hal Leonard ed.). Runner-up: 128 measures
      in Bruckner: Symphony no. 8 (1884-87), IV(?), triangle/cymbal
      part; this is part of a series of multibar rests and rests
      with cues totalling 248 measures.
   </li>

   <li>
		For grace notes (including appoggiaturas) {B&amp;I 5.5}: Grace
   	half notes in Mozart: Quoniam of the Great Mass in C minor,
   	K.427, bar 85, first violins and first soprano; John Wall Callcott:
   	"Zephyr, with thy downy wing" (both contributed by Bala).

      C.P.E. Bach's Versuch uber die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen
      (1762?; English translation as: Essay on the True Art of
      Playing Keyboard Instruments) gives examples of half- and
      even whole-note appoggiaturas. Runners-up: There are many
      examples of grace quarter notes.
   </li>

</ol>



<br /><h3>3. Most augmentation dots {B&amp;I 4.6, 6.7}</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Quadruple dots appear in Liszt: Piano Concerto #2 (1839, rev.
      1848; Kalmus ed.), Allegro deciso, mm. 327 and 331; Schumann:
      String Quartet no. 1, Op. 41 no. 1 (1842), III, mm. 16, 17,
      33, 34, etc. (contributed by Cuthbert) (in <a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/InterestingMusicNotation.html">Byrd,
      2017a)</a>; Verdi: Requiem (1874; Dover ed.), Rex Tremendae,
      mm. 356 and 358; Franck: Prelude, Chorale, and Fugue (1884;
      Schirmer ed.), mm. 2 and 4 (in B &amp; M, 1948); Hindemith: Mathis
      der Maler Symphony (1934; Schott ed.), III, introduction;
      Bartok: Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta (1936;
      Boosey &amp; Hawkes ed.), III, m. 80; and Einojuhani Rautavaara:
      Icons, Op. 6 (1955), I ("Jumalanäidin kuolema"), mm. 2-3
      (contributed by Arribas). In every case, the dots are on a
      half note.
   </li>

	<li>
       Runners-up: triple dots occur in Schumann: Carnaval (1835),
       last movement; Chopin: Piano Sonata no. 2 in b-flat, Op. 35
       (1840), I; Liszt: Mazeppa (1827; rev. 1837, 1854?), mm. 1-4
       (in B &amp; M, 1948); Sibelius: Violin Concerto, II; etc. These
       are all (or almost all) on notes, but a triple-dotted eighth
       rest appears in m. 15 of Heinrich's Toccata Grande Cromatica;
       triple-dotted quarter rests in mm. 2 and 3 of Rautavaara's
       Icons, I; and a triple-dotted half rest in Stockhausen:
       Zeitmasse (Universal ed., 1957).

	    		5:3 eighths, 5:3 eighths, 9:8 32nds, 3:2 32nds. However,
	    		it's doubtful if the last level--in this instance, at

	    		any effect would be far more subtle than other unintentional
	    		and (probably) intentional timing fluctuations; therefore,
	    		this notation is essentially conceptual.
	 		</li>

			<li>
				Runner-up: 3 in Stockhausen: Klavierstueck I (1952) (3:4, 7:8, 3).
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li> Largest "compression ratio"
		<ol type="i">

				With small notes (suggesting grace notes or a cadenza,

	<li> Complex/compound/irregular meters {B&amp;I 10.1}
		<ol type="i">
			<li>
	 			Most numerators in an "additive" (the term is from Read
	 			(1978)) meter: 4 in Bartok: Dance in Bulgarian Rhythm no.
	 			5, in Mikrokosmos (1926-39; Boosey &amp; Hawkes ed.) Book 6:

	 			des Oiseaux (1986): specifically, (3+2+2+2)/32.
      	</li>

			<li>
	 			Complexity of additive meters: The Sedi Donka is a Bulgarian
	 			folk dance dance. It (or a version of it) appears in *a
	 			book by Manol Todorov, where it is written as 7/8 + 7/8 +
	 			11/8, but it can be broken down further as (3+4)+(3+4)+(4+3+4)/8,
	 			and further still by replacing the 4's with 2+2's. In any
	 			case, the total number of numerator units is 25. (contributed

      	</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

   <li>
      Non-power-of-2 denominator: A time signature of 12/12 appears
      in the clarinet part of Franz Berwald's Quartet for Piano and
      Winds (1819!), II (vol. 13, p. 29 of the complete works).
      (The obvious way to express what seems to be intended would
      be simply 12/8! Perhaps the 12/12 is a mere mistake.)
      (contributed by Guerin) Herbert Bruen has used a denominator
      of 12, e.g., 5/12, I believe for what most people would write
      as (3+2/3)/8. Thomas Ades has written a measure of 2/6 time,
      consisting of a half note with a triplet 3 over it, i.e., 2/3
      of a half note; he's also written 1/6 in his *Asyla, II. But
      this kind of thing can also be written with unconventional
      numerators instead of denominators: Boulez has written what
      is probably the same thing as (2/3)/4. Time signatures like
      8/9 and 8/12 appear, e.g., in Frescobaldi, but apparently
      just to cancel previous proportions and not to indicate
      durations of 8/9 or 8/12 of anything, and this usage should
      not be considered CMN.

<h3>8. Shortest performed duration</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
      Normally-played notes. Alkan: Etude No. 7 ("Symphonie, Finale")
      from Douze études dans tous les tons mineures, Op. 39 (1857),
      is marked whole note = 96, so the 16ths in mm. 357-382 last
      39 milliseconds each. However, a live recording by Marc-André
      Hamelin is at whole note = 104 here, so that each note lasts
      a mere 36 ms.! (contributed by Bala) Runners-up: There are
      several likely candidates by Alkan. Chopin: Etude in C major,
      Op. 10 no. 1, in a 2005 recording by Vladimir Ashkenazy, has
      notes lasting about 80 ms. (16th notes at a tempo of ca.
      quarter = 200). NB: this is really the time between notes
      onsets; presumably the actual durations are slightly less.
   </li>

   <li>
      Other. Debussy: Pour le Piano (1901), I, has a glissando of
      30 notes, with each note's duration less than 30 milliseconds!
      The glissando has a notated duration just under a half note.
      (Of course, glissandi for keyboard instruments, unlike those
      for most others, involve discrete notes.) A realistic fast
      tempo is something like quarter = 150; at that tempo, a half
      note lasts about 800 millisec., so the duration of each note
      is less than 27 millisec.

		  				chord (and in the Beethoven cases, double-stemmed
		  				as both a single voice and independent voices).
		  				A clear-cut case of 4 voices on a staff occurs
		  				in the keyboard version of Bach: 6-Part Ricercare
		  				from the Musical Offering, and in Bach: "Jesu,

	    		605 + 937 = 6617 measures. (This seems to be the later,
	    		shortened version of the opera, in the 1982 Schott
	    		piano/vocal edition. That edition contains many additional
	    		passages without measure numbers--most marked "urspruengliche
	    		Version", i.e., original version--with an additional
	    		134 + 1094 + 163 + 108 + 85 = 1584 measures, for a total
	    		of 8201; since many of the superseded passages have
	    		replacements, neither the original nor the revised
	    		version includes all measures. Nonetheless--if measures
	    		printed rather than performed is the criterion--the
	    		latter value applies.) Runner-up: Hans Werner Henze:
	    		Koenig Hirsch (1952-55) is in three acts with 2471 +
	    		2225 + 990 = 5686 measures.
			</li>

			<li>
	    		In pages: This is very edition-dependent. The miniature
	    		score of Wagner: Die Meistersinger (in an old Schott
	    		edition, in three volumes) is 1441 pages. Runners-up:
	    		The full score of Janacek: The Excursions of Mr. Broucek
	    		("Die Ausfluge des Herrn Broucek", 1917; publisher
	    		unknown) is 1006 pages (in two volumes). The full score
	    		of Mussorgsky: Boris Godounov (Oxford ed.) is 929 pages
	    		(this is the record for a single volume); of Die
	    		Meistersinger (Peters ed., reprinted by Dover), 817.

			<li>
	    		In performance time: At least one performance of Kaikhosru
	    		Sorabji's Sequentia cyclica super "Dies irae" ex Missa
	    		pro defunctis, by a solo pianist, has lasted some 8 or
	    		9 hours (contributed by Isaacson). Runner-up: Kaikhosru
	    		Sorabji: Opus Clavicembalisticum for piano (1930) lasts
	    		about 4 to 4-1/2 hours. (Contributed by Fingerhut)
			</li>

			<li>
	    		In number of sections: Bartok's Mikrokosmos contains
	    		153 pieces, in six books. Runners-up: Ives' 114 Songs;
	    		Bartok's 44 Duos for Two Violins; Schumann's Album for
	    		the Young, Op. 68, contains 43 pieces, in two parts.

<h3>3. Tempo and metronome marks</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>Longest character string {B&amp;I 14.1} 
		<ol type="i">

	    		Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition starts with:

	    		Gedan)
			</li>

			<li>
	    		Runner-up: Beethoven: *Mass in C, Op. 86 has "Andante

			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Lowest number {B&amp;I 14.6}. For comparison, metronomes usually go down to M.M. 40.

	       	Pavana lachrymae, contains "half = 30 (quarter =
	       	60)". Martino: Impromptu for piano (1978) is marked
	       	"quarter &lt;= 36";

				Messiaen: Un Vitrail et des Oiseaux (1986) contains "eighth = 36".

				See also the description of the Bartok runner-up for highest number.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
      Highest number {B&amp;I 14.6}. For comparison, metronomes
      usually go up to M.M. 208. In most if not all of these examples,
      there's no consistent beat unit,  so the metronome mark is
      based on a unit below the beat level, resulting in very large
      numbers.

		<ol type="i">
			<li>
	    		16th = 906(!) in *Picken (1975, music example 17, p.
	    		305). This is an excerpt of a dance tune for the kemence
	    		(Black Sea fiddle), from Macka in the Black Sea area
	    		of Turkey; it was transcribed from a recording.

			<li>
	    		Runners-up: Hindemith: Sonata for Solo Viola, Op. 25
	    		no. 1 (1922), IV, is marked "quarter = 600-640". The
	    		notes for the Imai recording say that this is "completely
	    		absurd", and suggest that Hindemith wrote the marking
	    		tongue in cheek. That's a reasonable comment unless the
	    		shortest duration is a quarter and the beats are longer
	    		and irregular, which is in fact the case!
			</li>

	 		<li>
				Runner-up: Bartok: Dance in Bulgarian Rhythm no. 1,
	 			Mikrokosmos, Book VI, is marked "eighth = 350 (half tied
	 			to quarter tied to dotted quarter = 39)"; notice it's also
	 			a runner-up for lowest number. (The meter is (4+2+3)/8,
	 			so there's no consistent beat unit, but the numbers for
	 			all of the beat durations are somewhere in the middle.)
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
      Slowest in notated duration per unit time. Quintuplet 64th
      note = 75 in Stockhausen: Xi (1992) (contributed by Ingram).
	</li>

	<li>
      Shortest duration {B&amp;I 14.4}. Quintuplet 64th note = 75
      in Stockhausen: Xi. Runner-up: 64th = 288 in Crumb: Madrigal
      no. 1, from Madrigals, Book IV (1971).
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>4. Rehearsal mark</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
		Longest {B&amp;I 7.15}. Strauss: An Alpine Symphony has one
   	of four characters: "114a" (all or nearly all the other rehearsal
   	marks are the expected consecutive integers).

<h3>5. Performance direction (in the music, not on a separate page)</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Longest. Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique, Op. 14, IV, has one
      of 146 characters (in French): "Il faut frapper..."

</ol>



<h3>6. Part name or staff identification</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
	 	Longest {B&amp;I 1.10}. Ives: Putnam's Camp, in Three
	 	Places in New England, has one of 47 characters: "Long

	 	Haydn: Symphony no. 7 ("Midi"), II, has one of 38 characters:
	 	"Violoncello, Basso Continuo, e Fagotto".
	</li>

	<li>
      Longest abbreviated {B&amp;I 1.11}. Webern: Five Pieces for

<h3>7. Staff sizes</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Most simultaneous {B&amp;I 18.3}. 3 in J. C. Bach: Concerto
      for Harpsichord or Piano and Strings in E-flat, Op. 7 no. 5
      (Dobereiner ed., 1927). One size appears only briefly, for
      an ossia; this situation and number of sizes is surely not
      too unusual.
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>8. Note modifiers<h4>(accents, articulation marks, bowings, etc., but not fingerings)</h4></h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Most on a single note/chord: Bartok: Ostinato, no. 146 in
      Mikrokosmos (1926-39; Boosey &amp; Hawkes ed.), Book VI has
      several occurrences of 3 (accent, tenuto, staccato dot).
      Ligeti: Etudes for Piano, 2nd Book, no. 13 has many occurrences
      of 3 normal accents and many occurrences of 3 "hat" accents.
      Runners-up: 2 is not too unusual. Bartok: Allegro Barbaro
      (1911; Schirmer ed.) has accent and tenuto. In every other
      case I know of, one is a staccato dot, e.g., in Rachmaninoff:
      Prelude, Op. 23 no. 5; Debussy: Suite "Pour le Piano" (1901;
      Schirmer ed.), I; Stravinsky: Le Sacre du Printemps, Danses
      des adolescentes.

<h3>1. Pitch</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>	
      Earliest split stem (a.k.a. "grape cluster"): Chopin: Etude
      Op. 10 no. 11 (1831?; Paderewski ed.). Runner-up: Chopin:
      Mazurka in a, KK IIb no. 4 (1840). Both cases are for augmented
      unisons.
	</li>

	<li>
		Earliest microtonal notation: *A piece by Nicola Vicentino (in
		his "L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica", 1555) (contributed
		by McKay). Runners-up: *a four-voice work by Galeazzo Sabbatini (in
		Kircher's "Musurgia universalis", 1650) (contributed by McKay);
		Charles Delusse: *Air a la Greque (1760), which uses a + to indicate
		a raise of one quartertone (contributed by Wolf). In more recent
		times, I've seen J. Carillo (e.g., String Quartet (1895)) cited as
		a very early author of microtonal music.
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest diatonic tone cluster: Heinrich Biber: Battaglia for
      10 instruments (ca. 1673; in Schenk, 1997), 2nd mvmt., includes
      a 4-note tone cluster (in m. 9: C#,D,E,F#); several 3-note
      diatonic clusters; and at least one occurrence of two clusters
      in different scales simultaneously (D,E,F-natural, and--in a
      higher register--F#,G,A) (contributed by Wiering). This might
      be considered a 6-note cluster, but I think not, because of
      the change of register. (The different scales are because the
      passage is polytonal(!): various instruments are playing in
      C, D, and G.) Runners-up: Johann Kuhnau: Six Biblical Sonatas
      (publ. 1700), no. 1, "Der Streit zwischen David und Goliath"
      includes a cluster of C,D,E,G (contributed by Wolf). The
      earliest example with more than 4 notes is Cowell: The Tides
      of Manaunaun (probably 1917, not the claimed 1912) has
      white-key-only and black-key-only clusters of 2 octaves. (NB:
      as I use the term, the notes must be struck at once, and not
      just sound together, to count as a tone cluster. Also, I
      exclude acciaccaturas, examples of which can be found in many
      composers, including D. Scarlatti and J.S. Bach.)
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest chromatic tone cluster: Beethoven: Piano Concerto
      no. 4, Op. 58 (1805-06), I, 2nd theme includes a 3-note cluster
      produced by a 3rd-inversion dominant 7th chord with an
      ornamental note filling in the major 2nd: in the exposition,
      adding a G# to the chord's G,A,C#,E (contributed by Elkies).
      However, it's very short, and it's doubtful whether it's heard
      as a cluster. The earliest univocal example is Verdi: Otello
      (1887), Act I, which opens with a very lengthy cluster in the
      organ of 3 notes (C2,C#2,D2). Earliest example with many
      notes: Cowell: The Tides of Manaunaun has almost continuous
      chromatic clusters of 1 octave to ca. 2-1/2 octaves.
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest double sharp: Arnold (1983) mentions Trabaci's *Il
      secondo libro de ricercare (1615).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest 15ma: Cowell's piano piece Advertisement (1914).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest ledger line: Unclear. The article "Leger [Ledger]
      Line" in Sadie (2001) (as quoted in the Wikipedia article
      "Ledger line") says "Although ledger lines are found occasionally
      in manuscripts of plainchant and early polyphony, it was only
      in the early 16th century in keyboard music that their use
      became at all extensive." Of course plainchant and "early
      polyphony" aren't CMN. The article "ledger line" in Randel
      (2003) comments that an early example of the extensive use
      of ledger lines is Marc Antonio Cavazzoni's Recerchari Motetti
      Canoni for organ (1523), but this is probably not CMN
      either.
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>2. Duration and Rhythm</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Earliest tuplets (in modern notation): Emanuel Adriaensen's
      Pratum musicum (Antwerp, 1584) contains several triplets, one
      of which is indicated with a "3" below the affected notes.
      (Contributed by Crawford) Runner-up: Claude Le Jeune's setting
      of Psalm 35, Deba contre mes debateurs (publ. in 1598;
      transcription in Davison &amp; Apel, 1962), contains numerous
      triplets, but I have no idea how the triplets were notated
      in the original.
	</li>

	<li>
		Earliest nested tuplets

		<ol type="i">

			<li>
	 			Schubert: Adagio in G, D. 178 (1815!) uses triplets within
	 			triplets (contributed by Bala).
			</li>

			<li>
	 			Runners-up: Liszt: Transcendental Etude no.4 ("Mazeppa")
	 			(probably 1837 or earlier) uses triplets within triplets.
	 			(Caveat: This piece apparently was written in 1827, rev.
	 			in 1837, and rev. again in 1854, and I don't know in which
	 			version this feature was first used.)

	    		Chopin: *Allegro de concert, Op. 46 (finished by 1841),
	    		has sixteenth-note triplets inside eighth-note triplets
	    		(contributed by Bala). Alkan: *Etude No. 9 ("Concerto,
	    		Deuxième Partie") from Douze études dans tous les tons
	    		mineures, Op. 39 (1857), mm. 115-133, 172-175, and
	    		186-191: they are sixteenth-note triplets within
	    		eighth-note triplets. Wagner: Tristan und Isolde (1859;
	    		Dover ed.), Act III Scene I, p. 515, uses triplets and
	    		sextuplets within a triplet.
	 		</li>
      </ol>
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest tuplets crossing a barline: In Alkan: Morte (Op. 15
      No. 3, from Trois morceaux dans le genre pathetique, composed
      1837), mm.223-4 have 5:4 quarter notes spanning both bars,
      and mm. 303-4 have 9:8 eighth notes spanning both bars. The
      section is in 2/4.

      (Caveat re the measure numbers: this edition has several
      editorial barlines before this, so other scores may not agree
      on these numberings. Subtracting 23 from them should account
      for that.) Runner-up: Brahms: Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5
      (1853), V (4:3 quarter notes across the barline). (both
      contributed by Bala)
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest half-note triplets (i.e., triplet with total duration
      of a whole note): Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Op. 14
      (1830), I, bassoon and cello parts in mm. 282-83 (contributed
      by Hook).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of 32nd notes: G. Della Casa, Il vero modo di
      diminuir (printed in 1584), Libro Primo, p. 27 (contributed
      by Pugin). But this is arguably white mensural notation, not
      CMN.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of 64th notes: Orlando Gibbons: Pavane Lord
      Salisbury (publ. in Parthenia, ca. 1612; in Davison &amp; Apel,
      1962).
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of polyrhythm with non-coinciding barlines after
      1700: Mozart: Don Giovanni (1787), ballroom scene, has 3/4
      against 2/4 against 3/8.

      (Relative tempi are 2/4 quarter = 3/4 quarter; 3/8 dotted
      quarter = quarter of the others.)
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest feathered ("accelerando") beams: Risatti cites Heinz
      Holliger: *Mobile (1964). Runner-up: Roger Reynolds: Quick
      Are the Mouths of Earth (1965).
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest double dots: Chambonnieres: Les Pieces de Clavecin
      (Paris, 1670). Double dots appear in Livre 1, p. 51, and Livre
      2, pp. 2 and 49; they have their normal modern meaning.
      (Contributed by Crawford. The articles "Notation" in Sadie
      (1980) and Arnold (1983) mention this as an early example but
      make no claim of it being the first use, though Arnold says
      they were used from the 17th century onward. (Sadie (2001)
      appears not to mention any early examples. Read (1969) says
      they were first used in the late fifteenth century but gives
      no details, and it's a pretty far-fetched idea.)
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest note/chord tied to a rest or to nothing at all:
      Schumann: Piano Sonata no. 1 in f-sharp minor, Op. 11, II
      (1836; Henle ed.) (contributed by Bastin). Runners-up: Ravel:
      Jeux d'eau (1901); Scriabin: Poem(?), Op. 31? no. 2? (1903).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest chord with some but not all notes tied to the next,
      or from the previous, chord:

      (1) Non-arpeggiated: Beethoven: Piano Sonata no. 7, Op. 10
      no. 3, I (1797-98) has at least five; his Piano Sonata no.
      28, Op. 101, I (1816) also has some. But this notation is not
      all that interesting, and probably rather common as well.

      (2) Arpeggiated (with attack rhythm specified, i.e., not just
      via the arpeggio symbol): Haydn: Piano Sonata in E minor,
      Hoboken XVI (publ. 1784; Peters-Martienssen ed.), I, has
      several arpeggios of 2 or 3 notes with all notes tied into a
      single chord following. Runners-up: Beethoven: Piano Sonata
      no. 5, Op. 10 no. 1 (Schenker ed.), III, m. 112 has a 10-note
      grace-note arpeggio across staves/hands with all but the first
      4 tied into the following chords on both staves. His Piano
      Sonatas Op. 2 no. 3, I (1795); no. 11, Op. 22 (1800), IV; no.
      14, Op. 27 #2 ("Moonlight"; 1801), III, mm. 162-165; and no.
      23, Op. 57 ("Appassionata"; 1806), I, m. 123, each have
      arpeggios of up to 4 (5 in the "Moonlight" and "Appassionata"!)
      notes with all notes tied into a single chord following; in
      all but Op. 22, the notes are double-stemmed as both a single
      voice and independent voices (for all, Schenker ed.). (This
      notational feature is very interesting because it indicates
      a "blurring" of voices. The identical effect occurs much
      earlier, e.g., in Bach: Prelude to English Suite no.1 (1725?),
      mm. 2-3, but there it's notated--at least in the Bach-Gesellschaft
      edition!--as if the voices are really independent.)
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest beamed group crossing a barline: Beethoven: Piano
      Sonata no. 7, Op. 10 no. 3 (Schenker ed.; in B &amp; M, 1948),
      IV, mm. 1-2 and numerous places. Runner-up: Beethoven: Piano
      Sonata no. 10 in G, Op. 14 no. 1 (Schenker ed.), I, mm.
      121-122.
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest beamed group starting with a half-notehead: Chopin:
      Piano Sonata no. 1, Op. 4 (1828?; Schirmer-Mikuli ed.), I,
      p.4.

      But apparently this  device already occurs in some guitar
      music published around 1810. I (contributed by Crawford)

	<li>Earliest time signature uses
		<ol type="i">
			<li>Earliest use of different time signatures simultaneously.

		  				Act II Scene 5, recitative has repeated instances

					<li>
		  				Genuinely different: Variation 26 of Bach: Goldberg

	    		Clavier, Book II (1744; Bischoff/Kalmus ed.) has a time
	    		signature on both staves of "C" juxtaposed to 12/8.
			</li>

			<li>
	    		Earliest use of quintuple meter: Christopher Tye: In
	    		Nomine XXI: Trust for viol consort (mid-16th century)
	    		is entirely in 5/2 (contributed by Elkies). However,
	    		this isn't really CMN.

	    		Runners-up (and winners for unequivocal CMN): Handel's
	    		Orlando (1733), Act II, scene XI, "Ah! stigie larve...",
	    		pp. 65-66, contains a few measures in 5/8, which is
	    		also the earliest known use of that specific meter
	    		(contributed by Meckler); Chopin: Piano Sonata no. 1,
	    		Op. 4 (1828), III is in 5/4; Carl Loewe's ballad *Prinz
	    		Eugen, Op. 92 (1844).
			</li>

			<li>Earliest use of septuple meter:
				<ol>
					<li>
		  				Notated as such: Alkan: Impromptu, Op. 32 No. 8
		  				(1849!) (contributed by Bala); the meter is 7/4.
		  				Runner-up: Bartok: no. 2 of Two Elegies (for
		  				piano), Op. 8b (1909).
					</li>

					<li>
		  				Notated as a repeating pattern of measures of
		  				regular lengths: Reicha: 36 Fugues for Piano
		  				(1805) no. 24, is in "cut time + 3/4" throughout;
		  				it consistently alternates between the two
		  				(contributed by Murphy). Runners-up:  Brahms:
		  				"Variations on a Hungarian Song" Op. 21, No. 2
		  				(1854) is notated as 3/4 C; the theme and first
		  				eight variations consistently alternate between
		  				the two (contributed by Murphy). Brahms: Piano
		  				Trio in c, Op. 101 (1886), III is notated as 3/4
		  				2/4, but consistently has one measure of 3/4
		  				followed by two of 2/4.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>	
	    		The *Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (ca. 1619) contains
	    		several pieces with metric structures tantamount to
	    		irregular meters but notated as a repeating pattern of
	    		measures of regular lengths, e.g., 11/8 = 4/4 + 3/8
	    		(contributed by Elkies).
			</li>

			<li>
				Earliest non-integer time signature numerator:

	    		(3-1/2)/4 in Florent Schmitt: *La tragédie de Salomé
	    		(1907; Durand ed.).

	    		Runners-up: (4-1/2)/4 in Ives: *Piano Sonata no. 1
	    		(1909; Southern Music ed.); (4-1/2)/4 in Ives: "Concord"
	    		Piano Sonata no. 2 (completed 1915) (Kalmus ed.), III
	    		("The Alcotts"); (3-1/2)/4 in Varese: *Offrandes (1921).
	    		NB: Read (1978) lists dozens of works with fractional
	    		time signature numerators, and it's quite possible that
	    		some are earlier than those mentioned here.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest extended passage without barlines (after barlines
      came into general use, ca. 1600): "Anonyme [Louis Couperin?]
      [d'Anglebert?]" (so presumably mid-17th century): a four-page
      (23 systems) Prelude, in A minor, from "Suite III" (written
      entirely in whole notes, with bizarre slur-like things --
      some with loops -- all over the place; this is common in
      unmeasured keyboard preludes in that style). Runner-up: C.P.E.
      Bach: Free Fantasy in D (Wotquenne 117/14), in his Versuch
      uber die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen (publ. 1762), is
      just under a page (5 systems); the last "measure" of C.P.E.
      Bach: Fantasia in F (Wq 59/5) (1782) takes almost two pages
      (12 systems).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest tie: according to Rastall (1982), the first use of
      ties is in Marco Antonio Cavazzoni: *Recerchari, motetti,
      canzoni (1523).
	</li>

	<li>
		Earliest use of <i>accelerando</i>, <i>ritardando</i>, or equivalent:

      <i>Slentando</i> in Purcell's King Arthur (1691), Act III,
      at the end of "Cold Genius".

      <i>Slentando</i> appears in a 1710 manuscript copy; this
      presumably reflects Purcell's autograph. An 1813 edition is
      marked <i>ritardando</i> instead, which in any case is
      equivalent. (contributed by Solow)

      Runners-up for earliest use, and earliest use in print:
      <i>calando</i> in Mozart: Piano Sonata, K. 332 (1783), III,
      ending; <i>rallentando</i> in Beethoven's Trio, Op. 1, no. 2
      (1795), Finale; Beethoven's Piano Sonata no. 4, Op. 7 (1797),
      IV (all contributed by Solow). Note: Rastall (1982, p. 192)
      says "gradual changes of tempo...were an eighteenth-century
      addition", and mentions terms for both <i>accelerando</i> and
      <i>ritardano</i>, but gives no examples.
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest small notes: Bach: Organ Prelude in F minor, BWV 534
      (Bach-Gesellschaft ed.; ca. 1708 to 1717), bottom of p. 2.
      Runners-up: Bach: cantatas "Sie werden euch in den Bann tun",
      BWV 44, V, and "Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland", BWV 62 (both
      1724), II, III, and IV. All of these are in metrically-complete
      measures.
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>3. Dynamics</h3>



<p>
   Rastall (1982) contains a fairly extensive discussion of early
   uses of dynamic markings. In the items below, no distinction is
   made between words and their abbreviations, e.g., between <i>f</i>
   and <i>forte</i>.
</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Earliest use of any dynamic marking: Vincenzo Capirola's
      lutebook (ca. 1517) (Fig. 120 in the article "Notation" in
      Sadie, 2001).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>pian[o]</i> and <i>forte</i>: Giovanni
      Gabrieli: Sonata pian e forte, from Sacrae Symphoniae (1597).
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>mf</i>: Gluck: Orfeo ed Euridice (1762),
      Act II Scene 1. Runners-up: Haydn: Piano Sonata no. 9 in D
      (1767; Peters-Martienssen ed.), II; F. X. Richter: String
      Quartet in B-flat, Op. 5 no. 2 (1768). NB: Rastall (1982)
      says C.P.E. Bach used mf, but gives no details.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>mp</i>: Schütz: Saul, was vergolst du mich
      (ca. 1650) from Symphoniae sacrae III (Barenreiter; reprinted
      in Burkholder, 2006) (contributed by Cuthbert). Runners-up:
      Haydn: Quartet Op. 77 no. 2 (1799; pub. 1803), I (contributed
      by Solow); Liszt: Transcendental Etude no. 4 ("Mazeppa")
      (1827, rev. 1837). Rastall (1982) says <i>mp</i> appears later
      than <i>mf</i>, but gives no details. Badura-Skoda (1962)
      says Mozart knew of <i>mp</i> as well as <i>mf</i>, writing
      "pf" for the former, but gives no further details.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>fp</i>: Johann Stamitz: Sinfonia in E-flat
      ("La Melodia Germanica" no. 3) (1755), I. Runner-up: Mozart:
      Piano Sonata in F, K.280 (1774), III.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>pp</i>: Schütz: Saul, was vergolst du mich
      (ca. 1650) from Symphoniae sacrae III (Barenreiter; reprinted
      in Burkholder, 2006) (contributed by Cuthbert). Runners-up:
      Handel: The Messiah (1742), Nos. 17 ("Glory to God"), 18
      ("Rejoice greatly", final version), etc. Johann Stamitz:
      Sinfonia in E-flat ("La Melodia Germanica" no. 3) (1755), I;
      Haydn: Symphony no. 7 ("Midi") (1761), I. NB: Rastall (1982)
      says pianissimo "appeared early in the 17th century".
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>ff</i>: J.-J. Rousseau: Le Devin Du Village
      (1752), Scene 1, air "J'ai perdu tout mon bonheur". Runners-up:
      Johann Stamitz: Sinfonia in E-flat ("La Melodia Germanica"
      no. 3) (1755), I; Haydn: Symphony no. 7 ("Midi") (1761), I.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>ppp</i>: Beethoven: Piano Concerto no. 5
      in Eb ("Emperor"), Op. 73 (1809), I. Runner-up: Schubert:
      Erlkoenig, D. 328 (1815). NB: Warner (1977) says J. G.
      Tromlitz's Flute Treatise of 1791 mentions <i>ppp</i>.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>fff</i>: Haydn: Sieben letzten Worte (1787;
      Artaria), string quartet version and *orch. version (contributed
      by Hosar).

      Runners-up: Beethoven: Leonore Overture no. 3, Op. 72a (1806;
      Eulenberg ed.), m. 610; Beethoven: Piano Concerto no. 5 in
      Eb ("Emperor"), Op. 73 (1809), I. NB: Warner (1977) says J.
      G. Tromlitz's Flute Treatise of 1791 mentions <i>fff</i>.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>pppp</i>: Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique,
      Op. 14 (1830; Breitkopf &amp; Hartel ed.), V, m. 345, double bass.

      Runners-up: Berlioz's Roméo et Juliette (1839; Breitkopf &amp;
      Hartel ed.), no. 4, "La reine Mab, reine des songes", in the
      celli four bars before rehearsal no. 54 (contributed by Bala);
      Wolf: In der fruehe (1888; Peters ed.).
	</li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>ffff</i>: Unknown. Tchaikovsky: 1812
      Overture (1880) uses it, but his The Tempest, Op. 18 (1873)
      already used <i>fffff</i> (5 <i>f</i>'s).
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of <i>forte possibile</i>: Dussek: Piano Sonata
      in E-flat, Op. 44 (publ. 1800), I. An interesting runner-up
      is Chopin: Etudes, Op. 25 (1832-36; Paderewski ed.), nos. 10
      in b and 12 in c, but there were almost certainly other uses
      between 1800 and this.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest use of hairpins: According to Rastall (1982), hairpins
      are first used in the violin sonatas of Piani (1712). Distant
      runners-up: Haydn: Piano Sonatas no. 9 in D (1767), I; no. 2
      in e (1778), I; and no. 5 in C (1780), I (all Peters-Martienssen
      ed.); Mozart: Piano Sonata in D, K. 576 (1789), II (Presser/Broder
      ed.). But surely there were many uses between 1712 and 1767!
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>4. Other</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Earliest metronome marks: Beethoven published metronome marks
      for all of his (then) eight symphonies in 1817.
   </li>

	<li>
      Earliest chord with explicit "arpeggiate downward" indication:
      Chambonnieres' (d. ca. 1672) table of ornaments; d'Anglebert's
      table of ornaments (1689). (Both contributed by Zarky; both
      use a notation completely different from the modern form.)
      Runners-up: Bartok: Fourteen Bagatelles (1908; Schirmer ed.),
      no. 10 (indicated with the normal arpeggio sign, but after
      the chord instead of before); Krenek: Piano Piece, Op. 39 no.
      5 (1926) (this is the earliest with the now-standard arpeggio
      sign before the chord with an arrow on the bottom); Bartok:
      Piano Sonata (1926; Boosey &amp; Hawkes ed.), I. But it's very
      hard to believe there were no uses between 1689 and 1908!
   </li>

	<li>Instrument-specific
		<ol>
			<li>
	    		Bowed strings: Earliest explicit indication of what
	    		string something should be played on: Haydn: *Cello
	    		Concerto in D (1783), I (2nd theme). Runner-up: Beethoven:
	    		*Trio, Op. 1 No. 3, III (cello part). (contributed by
	    		Solow)
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Bowed strings: Earliest bowing marks: Arnold (1983)
	    		mentions Corelli: *Folia, Op. 5 no. 12 (1700).
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Bowed strings: Earliest glissando in natural harmonics:
	    		Rimsky-Korsakov: *Suite from the opera Christmas Eve
	    		(1895), in the section "Demonic Carol" ("Besovskaya
	    		Kolyadka").

	    		Runner-up: Ravel: Rapsodie espagnole (1908; Durand ed.),
	    		p. 40. (both contributed by Burkholder)
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Keyboard: Earliest explicit glissando: D. Scarlatti:
	    		Keyboard Sonatas K. 379 (1754 or earlier) &amp; *468
	    		(glissandi in both marked "con dedo solo") (contributed
	    		by Lindorff); cf. Kirkpatrick (1953), p. 188. Runners-up:
	    		Padre Antonio Soler used glissandi in some of his
	    		keyboard sonatas (contributed by Lindorff).

	    		An interesting runner-up, perhaps the earliest specifically
	    		for piano, is Clementi: Piano School (1801), Waltz 9
	    		(contributed by Solow).
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Piano: Earliest explicit use of una corda pedal:
	    		Beethoven: Piano Concerto no. 4, II.
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Piano: Earliest clear indication of "Ped. 3" (sostenuto
	    		pedal): Percy Grainger: *"Four Irish Dances (1907).
	    		Runners-up: Percy Grainger: *In a Nutshell (1916); K.S.
	    		Sorabji: Piano Sonata No. 2 (1920);  Busoni: *"Mit
	    		Anwendung des III. Pedals" in the 9th book of the
	    		Klavierubung (1923); Ruth Crawford-Seeger: *Prelude No.
	    		1 (1924). (all contributed by Gottlieb)
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Single-manual keyboard: Earliest use of more than two
	    		staves: In open score, Samuel Scheidt's *Tabulatura
	    		Nova (1624) (contributed by Zarky). In conventional
	    		keyboard notation, G. J. Vogler, Variations sur l'air
	    		de Marlborough (1791) (Fig. 125 in the article "Notation"
	    		in Sadie, 2001).
	 		</li>

			<li>
	    		Voice: Earliest use of sprechgesang (sprechstimme):
	    		Humperdinck: *Königskinder (1897) (cited in the article
	    		"Notation" in Arnold, 1983).
	 		</li>
