<ol type="a">
	<li>
      For comparison to well-known works, Stravinsky: Le Sacre du
      Printemps (1913), with its very large orchestra, uses a maximum
      of 35 staves and ca. 38 notated voices.

      R. Strauss: Elektra (1909), with an even larger orchestra,
      uses a maximum of 41 staves.
	</li>

	<li> Most simultaneous notated staves {B&amp;I 1.7}
		<ol type="i">

			<li>
	    		Ligeti: *Atmospheres (3rd ed., Universal) has a system
	    		of 77 staves on p. 15 (contributed by Elkies). The 1st
	    		ed. has "only" 70 staves (1961; Universal ed., p.13).
	    		The 56 strings are completely divisi in both editions.
			</li>

			<li>
	    		Runners-up: Penderecki: Symphony no. 1 (1975) has 71
	    		(there are two Schott editions; it's p. 33 in one, p.
	    		43 in another!).

       		(He uses a large orchestra, and the 46 strings are completely
       		divisi.) NB: the notation is typical Penderecki, and it might
       		be argued--but not, in my opinion, very convincingly--that
       		it doesn't belong here because it's not CMN. 61 staves in
       		Carter: Concerto for Orchestra (1969), on a page near the
       		end. A famous early example and more distant runner-up is a
       		Mass by Benevoli (1628) that uses 53 staves.

	    		Runners-up: 71 in Penderecki: Symphony no. 1, on the

			</li>

			<li>
	    		A more distant runner-up is Xenakis: Metastasis (1954-55),
	    		for 61 instruments, in which every player plays a
				separate part for the entire piece.
			</li>

	<li> Most simultaneous notated parts {B&amp;I 1.6}. NB: "part" is not
      really well-defined, so neither are these numbers.

	    		Joseph Schwantner: Magabunda (1983), near the beginning
	    		of the 2nd movement (cluster notation) (contributed by

	    		5 in the last pages of Sorabji: Opus Clavicembalisticum
	    		(1930), for piano.

			<li>
	    		Most simultaneous notated voices for one instrument and
	    		performer: The fugato in Alkan's Quasi-Faust (2nd
	    		movement of the Grande Sonate, Op. 33, composed 1847)
	    		goes up to at least 8 voices, 4 notated in each hand

		  				5 voices on a staff occurs momentarily in Bach:
		  				Prelude to English Suite no.1 (1725?; Bach-Gesellschaft
		  				ed.), mm. 2-3, and in Beethoven: Piano Sonatas
		  				Op. 27 #2 ("Moonlight"; 1801), III, mm. 162-165,
		  				and no. 23, Op. 57 ("Appassionata"; 1806), I, m.
		  				123 (Schenker eds.). But in all, it's simply a
		  				series of separately-attacked notes tied into a
		  				chord (and in the Beethoven cases, double-stemmed
		  				as both a single voice and independent voices).
		  				A clear-cut case of 4 voices on a staff occurs
		  				in the keyboard version of Bach: 6-Part Ricercare
		  				from the Musical Offering, and in Bach: "Jesu,
		  				Joy of Man's Desiring", arranged by Dame Myra
		  				Hess (Oxford ed.), mm. 29-31. 4 occurs in Beethoven:
		  				Piano Sonata no. 11, Op. 22 (1800; in 3 of 3 eds.
		  				I checked, including Schenker's), I, mm. 91-103,
		  				though it's simply a series of arpeggios with
		  				attack rhythm written out. 4 occurs in Beethoven:
		  				Piano Sonata no. 2, Op. 2 no. 2, I, p.24, m. 272,
		  				and no. 3, Op. 2 no. 3, I, mm. 221-225 (1795);
		  				Piano Sonata no. 11, Op. 22 (1800), I, mm. 91-103
		  				(all in 3 of 3 eds. I checked, including Schenker's);
		  				and repeatedly in Brahms: Intermezzo, Op. 119 no.
		  				1 (International ed.)--though in all it's simply
		  				a series of arpeggios with attack rhythm written
		  				out. 4 occurs repeatedly in Bach's solo violin
		  				sonatas and partitas, and in Brahms: Romance, Op.
		  				118 no. 5, but rarely if ever are the supposed
		  				voices truly all independent.
					</li>

					<li>

		  				Runners-up: 3 voices on a staff is fairly common
		  				in fugues for keyboard instruments written on two
		  				staves, e.g., the c-sharp minor Fugue in Bach:
		  				The Well-Tempered Clavier, I, and Bach: Goldberg
		  				Variations, no. 16. It's not that unusual even
		  				in keyboard music that's less contrapuntal,  e.g.,
		  				Schubert's song Der Juengling und der Tod (Peters
		  				ed.), and perhaps on wind staves in pieces for
		  				large orchestra. It also occurs in music that's
		  				much simpler, e.g., "Vigilante Man" in A Tribute
		  				to Woody Guthrie (Ludlow Music, 1972), where the
		  				main rhythm is in normal-size notes and two
		  				variants (for different verses) in small notes,
		  				one stem up and stem down. Chopin's Nocturne, Op.
		  				15 no. 2 (in <a
		  				href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/InterestingMusicNotation.html">Byrd,
		  				2017a)</a>, has beaming clearly indicating 3
		  				voices (and suggesting 4) on the staff even though
		  				there are only 1 or 2 notes at a time.

       NB: While not excluded, dramatic works are neglected here

				In measures (and quarter-note durations): Allan Pettersson: Symphony

				shortened version, 1843; Schott ed., 1982) has one scene of 1384
				measures; it's mostly in 2/2 or 4/4, but includes substantial

				measures from the original version, for a total of 2426, though no
				performance would include all (see below); nonetheless--if measures
				printed rather than performed is the criterion--this score holds
				the record. Runners-up:

	    		Mahler: *Symphony No. 8 (1906), 2nd movement, is 1572
	    		continuous measures (contributed by Bala).

	    		Alkan: Etude no. 8 ("Concerto, Premiere Partie") from
	    		Douze etudes dans tous les tons mineur, Op. 39, is 1342
	    		bars; it's in 3/4 (contributed by Starr). Schubert:
	    		Symphony no. 9, IV, is 1154 measures; it's in 2/4.
			</li>

			<li>
	    		In pages: Pettersson: Symphony no. 9 (Nordiska Musikforlager
	    		ed.) is one movement of 385 pages. Runner-up: Beethoven:
	    		Symphony no. 9, IV (Eulenberg ed.), fills 128 pages.
	    		(But this is very edition-dependent: in the Dover
	    		edition, this movement is only 88 pages.)
			</li>

			<li>
	    		In performance time: Satie: Vexations (unmeasured, 52
	    		beats to be repeated 840 times, lasting a total of about
	    		18 hours in the first performance). But this--while not
	    		unplayable--might still be disqualified as being
	    		conceptual. A clear-cut case, or at least runner-up:
	    		Pettersson: Symphony no. 9 is one movement lasting 65-70
	    		minutes. [Chopin: Mazurka Op. 7 no. 5 is marked "Dal
	    		segno senza Fine", i.e., infinite length! (Contributed
	    		by Nettheim) A case can made that the longest work of
	    		finite duration is John Cage's Organ^2/ASLSP (As SLow
	    		aS Possible). A performance in Halberstadt, Germany,
	    		began in September 2001, so it has been going on for
	    		over seventeen years; it is intended to last for 639
	    		years! (Cage himself didn't specify the tempo or duration
	    		other than via the phrase "as slow as possible"; a group
	    		of musicologists and philosophers chose the duration.
	    		Cf. the Wikipedia article "As Slow as Possible".)

			<li>
	    		In measures: no. 4 of Webern: Five Pieces for Orchestra,

	    		Runner-up: no. 3 of Webern: Three Little Pieces for
	    		Cello and Piano, Op. 11, is 10 measures (of 2/4). Not
	    		surprisingly, Webern is responsible for many candidates
	    		for shortest movement, depending on the exact criteria.
			</li>

			<li>
	    		In pages: no. 3 of Webern: Three Little Pieces for Cello
	    		and Piano, Op. 11, is one system of three staves--perhaps
	    		1/3 of a page.
			</li>

			<li>
	    		In performance time: no. 4 of Webern: Five Pieces for

	    		[Each of the three movements of John Cage's famous 4'
	    		33" (1960) is entirely silent and contains zero sounding
	    		notes: clearly a piece of much conceptual interest, but
	    		no musical interest in the normal sense. The same is
	    		true of Philip Corner: *One Note Once, which is exactly

			<li>
	    		If the Adagio between the two fast movements of Bach:

	    		it wins each of the above categories: it's one measure,
	    		less than 1/10 of a page, lasts just a few seconds, and
	    		contains only 20 notes. (contributed by Hiew) However,
	    		I'm inclined to consider it a mere transition between
	    		the first and third movements; besides, in performance,
	    		it's nearly always expanded with something improvisational,
	    		not played as written.

	    		shortened version of the opera, in the 1982 Schott

	    		Version", i.e., original version--with an additional
	    		134 + 1094 + 163 + 108 + 85 = 1584 measures, for a total
	    		of 8201; since many of the superseded passages have
	    		replacements, neither the original nor the revised
	    		version includes all measures. Nonetheless--if measures
	    		printed rather than performed is the criterion--the
	    		latter value applies.) Runner-up: Hans Werner Henze:
	    		Koenig Hirsch (1952-55) is in three acts with 2471 +

	<li>
      Highest number {B&amp;I 14.6}. For comparison, metronomes
      usually go up to M.M. 208. In most if not all of these examples,
      there's no consistent beat unit,  so the metronome mark is
      based on a unit below the beat level, resulting in very large
      numbers.

			<li>
	    		16th = 906(!) in *Picken (1975, music example 17, p.
	    		305). This is an excerpt of a dance tune for the kemence
	    		(Black Sea fiddle), from Macka in the Black Sea area
	    		of Turkey; it was transcribed from a recording.
	    		(contributed by Campin)

			<li>
	    		Runners-up: Hindemith: Sonata for Solo Viola, Op. 25
	    		no. 1 (1922), IV, is marked "quarter = 600-640". The
	    		notes for the Imai recording say that this is "completely
	    		absurd", and suggest that Hindemith wrote the marking
	    		tongue in cheek. That's a reasonable comment unless the
	    		shortest duration is a quarter and the beats are longer
	    		and irregular, which is in fact the case!
			</li>

	 		<li>
				Runner-up: Bartok: Dance in Bulgarian Rhythm no. 1,
	 			Mikrokosmos, Book VI, is marked "eighth = 350 (half tied
	 			to quarter tied to dotted quarter = 39)"; notice it's also
	 			a runner-up for lowest number. (The meter is (4+2+3)/8,
	 			so there's no consistent beat unit, but the numbers for
	 			all of the beat durations are somewhere in the middle.)
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
      Slowest in notated duration per unit time. Quintuplet 64th
      note = 75 in Stockhausen: Xi (1992) (contributed by Ingram).
	</li>

	<li>
      Shortest duration {B&amp;I 14.4}. Quintuplet 64th note = 75
      in Stockhausen: Xi. Runner-up: 64th = 288 in Crumb: Madrigal
      no. 1, from Madrigals, Book IV (1971).
   </li>
</ol>



<h3>4. Rehearsal mark</h3>



<ol type="a">
   <li>
		Longest {B&amp;I 7.15}. Strauss: An Alpine Symphony has one
   	of four characters: "114a" (all or nearly all the other rehearsal
   	marks are the expected consecutive integers).
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>5. Performance direction (in the music, not on a separate page)</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Longest. Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique, Op. 14, IV, has one
      of 146 characters (in French): "Il faut frapper..."
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>6. Part name or staff identification</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
	 	Longest {B&amp;I 1.10}. Ives: Putnam's Camp, in Three
	 	Places in New England, has one of 47 characters: "Long
	 	Snare Drum (snares muffled) or small Timp." Runner-up:
	 	Haydn: Symphony no. 7 ("Midi"), II, has one of 38 characters:
	 	"Violoncello, Basso Continuo, e Fagotto".
	</li>

	<li>
      Longest abbreviated {B&amp;I 1.11}. Webern: Five Pieces for
      Orchestra, Op. 10, has one of 19 characters: "Solo - Vlc. m.
      Dpf."
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>7. Staff sizes</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Most simultaneous {B&amp;I 18.3}. 3 in J. C. Bach: Concerto
      for Harpsichord or Piano and Strings in E-flat, Op. 7 no. 5
      (Dobereiner ed., 1927). One size appears only briefly, for
      an ossia; this situation and number of sizes is surely not
      too unusual.
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>8. Note modifiers<h4>(accents, articulation marks, bowings, etc., but not fingerings)</h4></h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Most on a single note/chord: Bartok: Ostinato, no. 146 in
      Mikrokosmos (1926-39; Boosey &amp; Hawkes ed.), Book VI has
      several occurrences of 3 (accent, tenuto, staccato dot).
      Ligeti: Etudes for Piano, 2nd Book, no. 13 has many occurrences
      of 3 normal accents and many occurrences of 3 "hat" accents.
      Runners-up: 2 is not too unusual. Bartok: Allegro Barbaro
      (1911; Schirmer ed.) has accent and tenuto. In every other
      case I know of, one is a staccato dot, e.g., in Rachmaninoff:
      Prelude, Op. 23 no. 5; Debussy: Suite "Pour le Piano" (1901;
      Schirmer ed.), I; Stravinsky: Le Sacre du Printemps, Danses
      des adolescentes.
	</li>
</ol>



<h3>9. Endings</h3>



<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Highest ending number {B&amp;I 20.1}.  9(!) in *"In the Heat
      of the Summer" in The Complete Phil Ochs Collection (Almo
      Publications, 1978). There's an ending marked "1.-8." for the
      first eight verses, and one marked "9." for the last(?) verse.

<h3>10. Instruments to be played by one performer in a piece<h4>(excluding percussion)</h4></h3>


<ol type="a">
	<li>
      Mahler: *Symphony no. 5 calls for one clarinetist playing six
      different instruments.
